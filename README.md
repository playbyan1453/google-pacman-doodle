Hi if you find these, maybe you love it. Because the game is most nostalgic at 1980's.
I just extracted all the files on pacman's doodle link by myself.

### Project Status and Issues
So this project it's still work in Progress
At pacman10-hp.11.js line 1194 and 1195 there is method to get file from javascript.
The method its not allowing to read the audio file and make the Pacman stuck at 75%.

### How the game should looks
You can check the live demo at [here](https://www.google.com/doodles/30th-anniversary-of-pac-man).
The game is pretty simple double click at insert coin you can multiplayer.
**Player 1** using arrow keys and **Player 2** using WASD keys.
You can download it at **Clone or Download** button
